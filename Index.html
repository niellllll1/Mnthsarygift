      <p>Hi, I know you're not a fan of long, sweet messages, whether they're typed or handwritten, but I wanted to write one to express what I feel. And I don't have enough money right now to buy some materials to create a gift for you, or buy you a flower or gift, so I hope this simple gift will make you smile.</p>
      <p> 
     First, I want to thank you for simply existing.  You make my world a brighter place just by being in it. Second, I want to thank you for your love, effort, and care. It means the world to me that you put so much thought and effort into making me happy.  Third, I want to thank you for choosing me out of all the many men who admire you. I just realized how lucky I am that you chose me, and I'll make sure you never regret it. </p>
